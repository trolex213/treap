# Treap
Implementation of the Treap data structure utilizing a self-balancing BST mixed with a heap priority to organize and search ordered data. 

## What is a Treap? 
A treap is a binary search tree (BST) which additionally maintains heap priorities. An example is given in Figure 1. A node consists of:

• A key k (given by the letter in the example),
• A random heap priority p (given by the number in the example). The heap priority p
is assigned at random upon insertion of a node. It should be unique in the treap.
• A pointer to the left child and to the right child node.

For example, the root node in the treap in Figure 1 has “h” as key and 9 as heap priority.
